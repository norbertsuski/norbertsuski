### Hi there, it's Norbert! ðŸ‘‹
I'm a senior frontend developer from Poland. I work at [Codetain](https://codetain.com) where I'm a developer, team leader, open source contributor and blog author. Iâ€™ll start telling you about myself from my roots. Before I became a programmer, my whole world was filming, photography, and making music. Happily, this part of me is still there. Oh, I almost forgot â€” basketball! I love both playing basketball and going to games. You can also call me a game boards geek â€” my day isnâ€™t complete without a round! Feel free to ping me at any of my social media listed below ðŸ‘‡
